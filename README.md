## [Description](#table-of-contents)

As a small team of motivated devlopers, we set out to provide a hiring solution for small to medium sized business owners. Our target audience often cannot justify spending a large sum on an enterprise applicant tracking system (ATS), but has just as much of a need to fill positions as any business.

Our completed application will prove invaluable to our customers, and the diverse features belie the low-price tag! Candidates can browse and apply to any job they desire. 
Admin users are able to view these applicants, and reach out to them to schedule an interview if they choose to. Additional admin features include the ability to create and delete job postings, and create other admin user accounts.

In building this application, we built valuable skills as developers, and as members of a functional team. We've delployed a stable, full stack solution that can be customized and easily implemented for any potential clients by leveraging the MERN stack and best practices!
